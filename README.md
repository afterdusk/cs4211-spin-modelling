# SPIN Assignment
CS4211 AY20/21 Semester 1

All error trails can be performed with the iSpin Simulate tab. The necessary pml.trail files are already included, so verification does not need to be run again.

If you would like to perform verification, all files label LTL claims  as "q", for ease of use.

Note: My attempts at Question 1 and 2 are fine (albeit not the cleanest); Question 3 is an absolute dumpster fire. Peruse at your own risk.
